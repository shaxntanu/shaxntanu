# Git koi

Git koi draws a pixel-art koi from a GitHub account's public activity. Its
languages color it, contributions grow it, streaks mark it, and recent activity
sets its swim pace. Five recently pushed repositories leave a trail, with each
marker tinted by its primary language. Public issues, pull requests, and reviews
leave ripples, lily pads, and bubbles. Event times set day, dusk, or night pond
lighting. The same tool runs from the command line, and the Rust library
underneath is published on crates.io.

## Usage

### Requirements

- For a koi on your profile README: a GitHub account. The Action runs in your
  profile repository's workflow with its built-in token.
- For the command line: a binary from the
  [releases page](https://github.com/yalongwastaken/git-koi/releases), or Rust
  at or above the `rust-version` in [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml), plus the
  [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com), authenticated.
- For the library: Rust at or above that same version.

[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) walks through all three: the
Action in a profile workflow, the command line, and the library. The API is
documented on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/git-koi).
